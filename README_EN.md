An Xposed module bringing system-level Sony headphone control to Xiaomi HyperOS.

### Supported models 

Theoretically supports all released Sony headphones

### HyperOS integration

- **Model spoofing** — presents Sony headphones as supported Xiaomi earbuds to the system headset UI
- **System battery injection** — battery synced into the system bluetooth stack
- **Focus Island / notifications** — connect & battery island, AOD battery, ANC-cycle notification button
- **Fusion device center** — battery and ANC state read/write
- **Quick popup** — control popup from the notification and on connection
- **Model images** — automatically matched from the Sound Connect model/colour catalog, without custom image configuration
- **Device handoff** — supports Xiaomi Interconnect device handoff (not recommended together with dual-device connection, as they may conflict)

### Usage

1. Install the APK, enable the module in LSPosed with scopes:
   `com.android.bluetooth`, `com.milink.service`, `com.xiaomi.bluetooth`, `com.android.settings`, `com.sony.songpal.mdr`
   (`com.sony.songpal.mdr` is the official Sony Sound Connect package; it lets SonyPods hand over the headphone connection while the official UI, keep-connection service, or control session is active, then restores it after the official session ends.)
2. Restart the scopes (one-tap root restart inside the app)
3. Open the app, grant Bluetooth / notification permissions, connect your Sony headphones

### Requirements

- HyperOS (Android 14+)
- LSPosed (libxposed API 102)
